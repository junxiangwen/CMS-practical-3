### Content Insights
There are a lot of features that can be done with wordpress, so I think it's a very useful tool for building websites that can easily remove the code part, which makes it very easy for a lot of people to get started.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Wordpress is now a very mainstream website editor, so I think I can build a foundation with this study and possibly use the knowledge at work in the future

## Interview

### communications
In group work, I think good communication is a must for a good group, only good communication can cooperate with each other and make a good project.

### responsibilities
A responsible team member must be a very good team member, he or she will do every assigned work conscientiously, and at the same time will actively help other team members.

### listening
I think listening is also a very important skill, because it is only by hearing voices that are different from our own that we can bring our ideas together and create new projects that belong to a group

### honorable
This is a very good quality, and I hope that everyone has this quality, only the team trust each other to do the work more efficiently.
### leadership
I think leadership may be more than one person, each group member has their own area of specialization, in their own area of specialization should lead the other members of the group in their own area of specialization to carry out positive teamwork, of course, a team must have a leader to bring a team together.
